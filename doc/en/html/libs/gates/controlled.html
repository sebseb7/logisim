<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The tri-state buffer and tri-state inverter, often called <em>controlled
buffers/inverters</em>, each have a one-bit "control"
input pin on the south side. The value at this control pin affects how
the component behaves:</p>
<ul>

<li>When the value on the control pin is 1,
then the component behaves just like the respective component, either a <a
href="buffer.html">buffer</a> or a <a href="not.html">NOT Gate</a> (a.k.a
"inverter").</li>

<li>When the control pin value is 0 or unknown (i.e., floating), then the
component's output is floating, regardless of the other input pin.</li>

<li>When the control pin value is an error value (such as would occur when two
conflicting values are being fed into the input), then the output is an
error value.</li>

</ul>

<p>Controlled buffers can be useful when you have a wire (often called a
<em>shared bus</em>) whose value should match the output of one of several
components, each of which is independently controllable by some control signal.
By placing a tri-state buffer between each component
output and the bus, you can control whether that component's output is
fed onto the bus or not.</p>

<h2>Pins (assuming component faces east, control line right-handed)</h2>

<dl>

<dt>West edge (input, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dt>
<dd>The component input that will be used to compute the output if the
control input is 1.</dd>

<dt>South edge (input, bit width 1)</dt>
<dd>The component's control input.</dd>

<dt>East edge (output, bit width matches Data Bits attribute)</dd>
<dd>The component's output, which will be floating if the control input
is 0 or floating, the error value if the control input is the error
value, and will be computed based on the west-side input if the control
input is 1.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When the component is selected or being added,
Alt-0 through Alt-9 alter its <q>Data Bits</q> attribute
and the arrow keys alter its <q>Facing</q> attribute.</p>

<dl>

<dt>Facing</dt>
<dd>The direction of the component (its output relative to its input).</dd>

<dt>Data Bits</dt>
<dd>The bit width of the component's inputs and outputs.</dd>

<dt>Gate Size</dt>
<dd>(Tri-state inverter only) Determines whether to draw a larger or a smaller
version of the component.</dd>

<dt>Control Line Location</dt>
<dd>The location of the control line, imagining we are facing the output
from the input: If the component faces east and is <q>right-handed,</q>
the control line is to the south; but if it is <q>left-handed,</q>
the control line is to the north.</dd>

<dt>Label</dt>
<dd>The text within the label associated with the gate.</dd>

<dt>Label Font</dt>
<dd>The font with which to render the label.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Poke Tool Behavior</h2>

<p>None.</p>

<h2>FPGA Synthesis</h2><p>Tri-state devides are not supported for synthesis.</p>
