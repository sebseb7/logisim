<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The Move Tool allows the user to select and rearrange existing components and
wires. It behaves identically to the <a class="icon" href="edit.html"><img
    src="../../../icons/edit.gif"> Multi-Tool</a>, except that it can't add new
wire segments or directly modify existing wires. It is mainly only for selecting
and moving things.

<ul>
<li><p><img class="nonicon" src="multi-select-anim.gif" style="float: right; border: 1px solid gray;">
A simple click on wire or a component, without dragging, will simply
select the the component or wire segment. Holding <span class="key">shift</span>
while clicking a wire or component will add it to the current selection if it
was not there already, or will remove it if it was. After selecting the desired
items in the selection, you can of course cut/copy/paste/delete/duplicate all
the items via the <a href="../../guide/menu/edit.html">Edit menu</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>Click then drag the mouse on the background (i.e. starting at a location
not contained within any components) to begin a rectangular selection. All
components that are fully contained by the rectangle will be selected. Holding
<span class="key">shift</span> while making a rectanglar selection will add the
new elements if they were not there already, or will remove them if they
were.</p></li>

<li><p>Clicking and dragging a currently-selected component or wire segment will
begin moving all elements of the selection.</p>

<p>By default, Logisim will compute a way to add new wires, or remove or shorten
existing wires, so that no existing connections are lost during the move.
If you're performing a move where you do not want these changes to be made, you
can press the <span class="key">shift</span> key during the move. If you want to
disable this behavior entirely, go to Project &gt; Options, select the Canvas
tab, and uncheck the <q>Keep Connections When Moving</q> box; in this case, the
connections are computed only when the <span class="key">shift</span> key
<em>is</em> down.</p>

<blockquote class="warning">
    Note: <b>Dragging a selection containing wires</b> can somteimes lead to
    surprises. If you drag a selection including some wires on top of some other
    wires, all wires are merged, and the newly-merged wires are added the
    selection.  As a result, if you then drag the selection a second time, the
    wires previously at the location will not be left behind. This behavior is
    in keeping with the rule in Logisim that wires never overlap. And it does
    not normally constitute a major problem: Logisim will draw the full
    selection in the midst of dropping, and you should not drop it until you are
    sure it is in the correct location.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Some keys have an effect when items have been selected.</p>

<ul>

<li><b>Rotate components</b> using the arrow keys 
<span class="key">Up</span>
<span class="key">Down</span>
<span class="key">Left</span>
<span class="key">Right</span>. This 
changes the Facing attribute for all components in the
selection that have such an attribute.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Remove components and wires</b> using 
<span class="key">Delete</span> or
<span class="key">Backspace</span> keys.
These will delete everything selected from the circuit.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Duplicate components and wires</b> using the
<span class="key">Insert</span> key. This will create a duplicate of all
currently-selected wires and components. </p></li>

</ul>

<p>When duplicating a selection or pasting, Logisim does not immediately place
the new components into the circuit; instead, the selection will be a collection
of "ghosts," which will be dropped into the circuit as soon as they are either
deselected or dragged to another location.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>None. Selecting a component, though, will display its attributes.
With multiple components selected, attributes shared by all are shown,
blank if they have different values and otherwise with the value they
all have in common. (Wires are ignored if there are any non-wires in
the selection.) Changes to the attribute value affect all selected
components.</p>
