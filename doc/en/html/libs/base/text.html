<em>Text Tool</em></h1>

<h2>Behavior</h2>

<p>The Text Tool can add free-form text comments to a circuit, or create and
edit labels associated with components. Most components in the built-in
libraries support labels, though some do not.</p>

<p>For components that can take a label but have none assigned to it currently,
click anywhere within the component to add a label. If there is already
a label, click with the label to edit it.</p>

<p>Click any blank area of the canvas to add a new text comment, or click an
existing text comment to edit it.</p>

<h2>Attributes</h2>

<p>When editing a label for a component, that component's attributes are
displayed.</p>

Text comments have the following attributes:

<dl>

<dt>Text</dt>
<dd>The text appearing in the comment. This can be edited by changing the
attribute in the attribute table, or using the <a class="icon"
href="text.html"><img src="../../../icons/text.gif"> Text Tool</a> directly the
canvas.</dd>

<dt>Font</dt>
<dd>The font used for the comment.</dd>

<dt>Horizontal Alignment</dt>
<dd>Controls the horiztonal alignment, as well as where the text appears relative to
the origin (i.e. where the mouse was clicked when creating the comment).  "Left"
uses left-alignment, and positions the text so its left edge is at the origin.
"Right" uses right-alignment, and positions the text so its right edge is at the
origin. "Center" horiztonally centers each line, and positions the text
horizontally so the center is at the origin.</dd>

<dt>Vertical Alignment</dt>
<dd>Controls the where the text appears relative to the origin (i.e. where the
mouse was clicked when creating the comment). "Base" positions the text so the
origin is at the baseline of the first line of text. "Top" positions the text so
the origin is at the top of first line of the text. "Bottom" positions the text
so the origin is at the bottom of the last line of text. "Center" centers the
text vertically at the origin.</dd>
